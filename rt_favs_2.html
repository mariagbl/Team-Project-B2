    <p class="analysis">As there are months in which Trump tweets more about migration than others, it is understandable that he will receive more favs on his comments. To control this variation, we decided to look at the actual rate of favs per tweet, to see whether the support and impact of Trump’s rhetoric have increased.<br> 
    <br>   The graphs below show a growing trend of support and impact of Trump’s tweets on migration. This proves that independently from the volume of tweets, which may vary according to the electoral and political junctures, Trump’s tweets are receiving more attention and support from the audience.<br> </p>
