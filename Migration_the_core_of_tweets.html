	<p class= "subtitle" align="center">It is a fact that migration is a relevant topic in Trump’s political communication, but how much of his Twitter activity occurs around this topic.<br> To analyze the relative frequency of Trump’s comments on migration, <br> we visualize the total amount of tweets by @realDonaldTrump compared to the percentage of those tweets dedicated discuss migration.</div>
	<p class="lead mb-0" align="center">Key Learning: As shown in the graph, Trump is not currently tweeting at his highest level, however, in January 2019  about 33% of his tweets were related to migration issues. <br>This means that for every 10 tweets coming from Trump’s account, <br> at least three of them are related to migration. <br>Although the graph shows parallelisms between the two lines with peaks in similar months,<br> the visualization of migration-related terms conceives a more consistent trend in which the discussion on migration by Donald Trump has steadily increased over his presidency.</p>
